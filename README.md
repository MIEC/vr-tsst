# ECG VR-TSST v2.3

The Entertainment Computing Group VR-TSST (ECG VR-TSST) is a tool for experimental induction of acute mental stress in the laboratory. It is a VR adaptation of the original Trier Social Stress Test protocol developed by Kirschbaum, Pirke, and Hellhammer (1993). The ECG VR-TSST works with HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. 

The ECG VR-TSST has been successfully used to generate high stress levels in several studies (Liszio, Graf & Masuch, 2018; Liszio & Masuch, 2019). 

The application is available in the current version 2.3 in German and English and has a modular design. Different tasks for the subjects can be combined. Furthermore, the number of virtual testers can be varied. The ECG VR-TSST also has a logging module.

Further information about the scope and the empirical evaluation of the tool can currently be described here: https://doi.org/10.17185/duepublico/74774.

The ECG VR-TSST under is the GNU General Public License v3.0.
